## What is PAPI?

```markdown
A Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) is a visual aid that provides guidance for pilots during runway approach.

| PAPI Light Pattern | Meaning | Action Required |
|-------------------|---------|-----------------|
| All white | Too high | Descend substantially |
| 3 white, 1 red | Slightly high | Descend slightly |
| 2 white, 2 red | Correct path | Maintain approach angle |
| 1 white, 3 red | Slightly low | Climb slightly |
| All red | Dangerously low | Climb immediately |
```

The standard PAPI system consists of four light units positioned beside the runway that create these distinct patterns based on the aircraft's approach angle.

## Why PAPI Calibration Matters
Accurate PAPI calibration is critical for flight safety as it:
- Ensures pilots receive precise visual guidance during approach
- Prevents potential runway excursions or hard landings
- Maintains standardized approach paths across different airports
- Provides reliable guidance in varied weather conditions
- Meets regulatory requirements set by aviation authorities

## Current Calibration Challenges
Traditional PAPI calibration requires:
- Specialized aircraft with photometric equipment
- Multiple flyovers at precise angles
- Significant runway operational disruption
- Substantial expenses (typically $15,000-25,000 per calibration)
- Scheduling constraints leading to potential delays in maintenance
