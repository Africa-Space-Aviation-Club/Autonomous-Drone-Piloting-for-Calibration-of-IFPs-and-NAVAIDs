# Drone-Based Flight Calibration System

## Project Overview
This innovative project aims to revolutionize the calibration of aerodrome landing aids and Instrument Flight Procedures (IFPs) by replacing traditional aircraft-based methods with autonomous drone technology. Our solution addresses the high costs and logistical challenges associated with conventional calibration while maintaining compliance with ICAO standards.

**Phase 1 Implementation:** Our initial focus is on the calibration of Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) systems, which provide crucial visual guidance to pilots on the correct approach angle to a runway. PAPI calibration represents an ideal starting point due to its well-defined parameters and critical safety importance.

## The Problem
Flight calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of aviation navigation systems including:
- Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI)
- Instrument Landing Systems (ILS)
- VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR)
- Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)
- Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) procedures

Currently, these calibrations require specialized aircraft that are:
- Expensive to operate and maintain
- Logistically challenging to deploy
- Resource-intensive
- Environmentally inefficient

## Our Solution

```markdown
An autonomous drone-based calibration system that leverages:

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Advanced Drones** | Specialized UAVs with precision measurement sensors |
| **AI Analytics** | Machine learning algorithms for calibration analysis |
| **GNSS Integration** | Real-time centimeter-level positioning accuracy |
| **Automated Flights** | Precise path execution with minimal human intervention |
| **Cloud Processing** | Scalable data processing and reporting infrastructure |
```

This system can perform calibration flights at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods while ensuring compliance with ICAO Annex 10 and Doc 8071 standards.
